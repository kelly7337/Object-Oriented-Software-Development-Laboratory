2. I created a file and then write something in it.And read it. 
   The program worked as expected.

3. Visit() which is implemented by the visitor and is called for every element in the data structure; 
   visitable classes providing Accept() methods that accept a visitor.

4. Object Delegation means using the object of another class as a class member of another class.
   Using delegates in visitor pattern, we can eliminate the need for an additional class.

5. If we have lots of unique visitors, it makes it hard to extend. And we should know the return type 
   of visit() methods at the time of designing otherwise we will have to change the interface and all 
   of its implementations.
