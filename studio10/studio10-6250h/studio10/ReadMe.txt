2. (1)An insert interator is a special type of output iterator 
      designed to allow algorithms that usually overwrite elements
      to instead insert new elements automatically at a specific position in the container.
      Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers.

   (2)The essential difference between the set and the multiset is that 
      in a set the keys must be unique, while a multiset permits duplicate keys.
      The output shows this because there is a difference in behavior 
      when I try to insert duplicate keys into a set and into a multiset.
