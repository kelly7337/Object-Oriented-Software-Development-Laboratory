Answer the studio 17 questions here.

1. Name: Ermu Lu

2. I write to the ImageFile, and test "getSize" and "getName".
   The program worked as expected.

3. By using references to interfaces instead of their concrete implementation classes help to minimize ripple effects, 
   as the user of interface reference doesn't have to worry about the changes in the underlying concrete implementation.

4. Only in createFile, because I need to use if to make sure what type of file I would like to create.
