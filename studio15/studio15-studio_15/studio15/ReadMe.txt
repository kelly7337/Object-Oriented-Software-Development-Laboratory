2. An assignment expects an lvalue as its left operand, r-value can appear 
   on right but not on left hand side. Therefore, with lvalue, I can take 
   an lvalue argument and produces an rvalue through the address-of operator &,
   and on the left side of the assignment we have an lvalue, on the right side 
   an rvalue produced by the address-of operator.
