2. From the output, it is obvious that the constructor will be called whether 
   the space is allocated on the stack or the memory is allocated by new on the heap.

3. The default inheritance access rights are different, 
   struct is public, class is private.
   The variables in the first class is private, so they are cannot be used outside
   this class.

4. I initialize the variable to 30, and then program's output is 30.

5. The first output is the variables initial values.
   The second output is 7, 3.
   The copy constructor initializes the created object with 
   the previously created object in the same class when the object is created.

6. This time, the objects newly created by using other objects of the same kind.
   And copy the object and pass it as a parameter to the function.
   Copy the object and return this object from the function.
