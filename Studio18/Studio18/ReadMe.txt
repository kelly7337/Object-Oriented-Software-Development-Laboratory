1. Name: Ermu Lu

2. Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without 
   specifying their concrete classes. In SimpleFileSsytem, it would be easier to create different file types.
   We know that SRP states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." Therefore, the factory
   method must be more usefull.

3. Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to 
   concrete factory classes. I only need to create a new concrete factory class and pass it to the client code. This is
   an advantage.
   Factory classes are useful when I need a complicated process for constructing the object, when the construction need a 
   dependency that I do not want for the actual class, when I need to construct different objects etc.
   Yes, it can be used to create files for both.

4. I created the file, and tried to add files.
   The program runs as expected.

5. No, it not depends on any concrete file types.
